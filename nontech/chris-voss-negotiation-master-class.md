# Negotiation Master Class

## Mirroring
### Misconception of negotiation
It's a common misconception of negotiation is that you need to have an argument, come prepared and state all the reasons people should make the deal with you.
But this is not the case in real life effective negotiation. Instead, you need to know what other people think, help them clarify what they want, make them feel engaged and make they think they want to work with you to get what they want.

### What does Mirroring Do
1. It makes people feel engaged, involved, which consequently helps you get to tease out information that you won't get otherwise.
2. It helps you gather information.
3. It helps you to build rapport with other people. There's a saying goes "Interesting people are interested". People love to be encouraged to go on.
4. It helps you get to your goal: to let the other side to have your way.

### How to mirror
1. Simple repetition of last 1-3 words of what the other side say
2. It makes the other person think you listen to what they say carefully


### Mirror confrontational people
It's common in business negotiation where you want to make situation less hostile and more collaborative. Mirroring your counterpart help to avoid confrontation. It takes 2 people to fight. Be nice, use a great tone of voice and genuine curiosity to listen to the other side and seek for collaboration.

### Silence of golden
It's important to stop and let the other person talk after mirroring.

## Emotion Labelling
Labels are verbal observations. It triggers contemplation if your label is correct, and it deactivates the negativity if there's any. It helps to build up a trust-based influence.

### Steps of labelling
1. Be aware of the emotion or the dynamic from the other side
2. Label it, and fill in the black, e.g. "You sounds like _", "You seems like _", "It feels like _", etc.
3. Try to build a trust-based influence.

### How NOT to label
1. Don't start with "What I'm hearing is ..." otherwise you make people feel you are interested in YOUR perspectives than theirs.
2. Resist your urge to explain your thoughts after labeling or talk. Let the other side think. Let it trigger the type of contemplation you intend to trigger.
3. Even you have a second or better label, let the first one sink in before providing a new one.


### Label More Than Once
1. Labels can be accumulative.
2. A lack of response to a negative label is a good sign that you are on the right track. You just need to do more in the next steps.


### Reinforce Positive Emotions
Find the real positive emotion under the surface, label it, and you'll reinforce the positive emotion.

### Mirroring and Labelling in Tandem
1. Mirrors help you get closer to the dynamic or the emotions the other side is feeling.
2. You can mirror the response of a response to your label, to get more information, or expand on something you are interested in or want to confirm.

### Mastering delivery
1. Your voice, tone, deliveries matter.
2. Don't let your inner voice betrays you.
3. Your body language should match your tone.

### Manipulate mirror neurons
If you want someone to calm down, use a calmed voice.

### Ditch the "Assertive" Voice
1. There are 3 tones of voice combined with 2 inflections. 
2. The assertive tone of voice is always counterproductive.
3. Anger always gives negative impression and bad for long-time relationship.
4. The natural-born assertives need to fix their voice.

#### Use the "Playful" Voice
1. This should be the default voice. Use it 80% of the time.
2. You want to tell somebody the truth but also make sure it lands softly.
3. Smiley voice keeps the collaboration.

#### Use the "Analyst" Voice
1. Downward inflecting voice.
2. It's declarative, but with a downward, slow, soothing tone. 
3. Use it rarely but use it when you need it.

#### Use the "Late Night, FM, DJ" Voice
1. Use it 10% - 20% of the time
2. Use it when the other side is anxious, and you want to calm someone.

#### Inflections
An inquisitive voice indicates deference, and people like deference. 

### Digital Communication
1. Don't put too much in just one communication.
2. Make only one move in one communication.
3. Always ends positive and softly.

## Body Language and Speech Pattern
- During negotiation, don't be too self conscious and swift focus from yourself to the other side.
- You should be a sponge and soak up as much information as possible.

### The 7/38/55 Rule
The ratio of the content, the tonality and the body language should be 7/38/55.
Tonality and body language are usually more important than the content. If the content doesn't match the tonality or the body language, look for tonality and body language and use label to break through to get more information.

### Watch the Sidelines
The people that are off the point of focus are going to be ridiculously real in their body language because they are not used to be paid attention to.
You get honest and real body language/reactions from people who are off the primary contact.

### Identify Baselines and Spot Deviation
People have many ways to lie but only one way to tell the truth.
When you go on a polygraph, a good polygrapher is going to ask you some control questions (questions that are the truths), e.g. what's your name, what day is it today, what's your dog's name, so that they get a line on what you look like when you are telling the truth.

### The Pinocchio Effect
People use more words than necessary to answer your question. It's likely that they are lying.

### How to Respond to a Lie
- You should be able to sense that people have come out of truth telling and realize that there's something people are uncomfortable with. For instance, you could say something like "Well, I heard you say you're OK with the deal, but seems like something's bothering you?", "Seems like there's something I missed?", "Seems like there's more here than meets the eye?"
- Don't be accusatory; instead, use a curious tone of voice to indicate that you are collaborative and interested
- If people lie, they perceive you as a threat, and are afraid to tell you the truth. You should use the late-night FM DJ voice.
- Be predictable in that you're not going to attack them.
- Be nonjudgmental, be steady and accountable.
- Show that you are okay with what they think/feel now and drop their guard.

## Creating the Illusion of Control
The secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control.

### Ask "How" and "What" Questions
- Calibrated questions are open-ended questions, and they are calibrated for a fact. We calibrate it to make the other side feel in charge.
- Ask calibrated questions with "what" and "how" because people love to be asked what to do and how to do.
- Don't use "Why" because "why" as a question triggers defensiveness universally.

### Ask Questions to Force Empathy
Sometimes we need the other side to think in our shoes. We could just ask a simple question "How am I supposed to do it?"

### Use Calibrated Questions to Shape Thinking
- How am I supposed to do that?
- What's going to happen if I do that?
- How am I going to overcome the challenges here?

### Avoid triggering Reciprocity
You don't want to trigger reciprocity inadvertently, as people universally don't like to owe and are cautious about this.

### Ask Legitimate Questions
Let the other side stop and think about the situation which could potentially reshape their thinking.

## The Accusations Audit
- An accusations audit is taking a step back, and taking an inventory, doing an audit of all the possible negatives, names, accusations, slanderous things that the other side might be thinking about me, based on the circumstances, or the environment, or their own paranoia. Make a list, and go after them early on and quickly, fearlessly. 
- Unexpressed negative emotions never die. 
- You should go identify these negative thoughts and feelings, go after them, and trigger a collaborative environment. 

### Framing an Accusations Audit
You can frame an accusations audit when you feel the other side starts having negative feels on you or on the situation. That you bring this up fearlessly and with sincere could bring positive feedback from the other side.

### Getting Ahead of Negatives
Example: getting a late checkout from a hotel clerk.

### Be Exhaustive and Fearless
It's rare that you're going to overdo it. 
Be as forward thinking as possible.
When you know you've done a good job: Y lay out your accusations audits, read the other side's reaction all long the way. If you have 15 items in the list and you've gone through the first three and the side says "Oh, you're being too hard on yourself", you know that you have done your job and have forced empathy into this situation and make the other side think for you.

### Low-stakes practices
Test drive the techniques.

## The Value of "No"
"No" is not a failure. With "No" you can get much arther and get much information. It will actually enhance your relationship with people when you make them feel not only it's okay to say no but also no is a really good answer. 

### The Danger of "Yes"
There are 3 types of yes
- commitment
  - very concise and curt
- confirmation
  - agreement, kind of concise and curt but depends on context
- counterfeit
  - given when people feel trapped, don't trust you.
  - typically it's not short. It really means no, or maybe
"Yes" can be confusing. It's a good idea to phrase your question the other way, making it a "no" question.

### The Power of "No"
A "no" to a properly phrased no-oriented question is worth at least 5 yes'.
People feel safe and protected when they say no. It's human nature law of gravity.
When people say no, they don't have any burden of commitment and are more willing to give you additional information.
Do you agree -> do you disagree?
Is it a good idea -> is it a ridiculous idea?

### Use "No" to Get an Answer

### Transition From "No" to "How"
